        "# 1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). It is based on four main principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that objects of the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It has its own values for the attributes defined in the class and can use the class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary parts. Example: A car’s interface (steering wheel, pedals) hides the engine mechanics.\n",
        "- **Encapsulation** restricts direct access to some components and prevents unintended modifications. Example: Using private variables (_var, __var) in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python that begin and end with __.\n",
        "Example: __init__() (constructor), __str__() (string representation), and __len__().\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent). This promotes reusability and hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows the same method name to be used for different types. Example: A draw() method may behave differently for Circle and Rectangle classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- By using private (__var) and protected (_var) variables and defining getter and setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor (__init__ method) initializes an object when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Class methods** (@classmethod): Operate on the class itself and can modify class variables.\n",
        "- **Static methods** (@staticmethod): Independent functions inside a class that don’t modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Python does not support true method overloading but allows default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs) to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- A child class redefines a method from its parent class to provide a specific implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- @property allows defining getter methods for attributes, making them readable like properties instead of calling methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- It increases flexibility and scalability by allowing a single interface to support multiple implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class (from abc module) cannot be instantiated and must have at least one abstract method, enforcing subclasses to implement it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code reusability (inheritance)\n",
        "- Scalability and modularity\n",
        "- Encapsulation enhances security\n",
        "- Easy maintenance and debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class variables are shared among all instances (defined outside methods).\n",
        "Instance variables are unique to each object (defined inside methods using self).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class can inherit from multiple parent classes, allowing it to combine behaviors from different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- __str__(): Returns a user-friendly string representation (str(object)).\n",
        "- __repr__(): Returns an unambiguous representation for debugging (repr(object)).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20.What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- super() allows access to the parent class’s methods, enabling method overriding and multiple inheritance handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- __del__() is the destructor method, called when an object is deleted to free resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **@staticmethod**: No access to instance (self) or class (cls).\n",
        "- **@classmethod**: Works with class (cls) and can modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- It allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single statement by returning self.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- It makes an object callable like a function, allowing instances to be used as functions."
